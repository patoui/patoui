## Hi there 👋, I'm Pat! 😄

I'm a Senior Product Engineer primarily working in/with PHP but love discovering/trying new technologies (currently learning Go lang and TypeScript)!

### 🙋‍♂️️ About me

- 🛢 I enjoy working with large datasets as I find the challenges, technologies, and strategies facinating. I've finished reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann](https://dataintensive.net/) on this topic and gained some valuable knowledge and insights, I highly recommend this book
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a variety of PHP projects utilizing some great open source projects! [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- 🏠 I'm currently working on a [Laravel package](https://github.com/patoui/laravel-clickhouse) which wraps the [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) extension by [SeasClick](https://github.com/SeasX/SeasClick)!
- 🌱 Facinated by [Go lang](https://go.dev/)! Big thanks to [GoTime](https://x.com/GoTimeFM) and [Go With Domain](https://threedots.tech/go-with-the-domain/)
- 🦕 Intrigued by the [Deno](https://deno.land) runtime, looking for excuses to build something with it!
- ✌️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything OSS but haven't quite found something I'm very interested in yet (open to suggestions!)
- ❤️ Beer🍺️, Coffee ☕️, Cycling 🚴‍♂️️, Hiking 🗻️, Camping 🏕️
