## Hi there 👋, I'm Pat! 😄

I'm a Senior Backend Engineer primarily working in/with TypeScript/NodeJS but love discovering/trying new technologies!

### 🙋‍♂️️ About me

- 🛢 I enjoy working with large datasets as I find the challenges, technologies, and strategies facinating. I've finished reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann](https://dataintensive.net/) on this topic and gained some valuable knowledge and insights, I highly recommend this book
- 📖 I’m currently reading [Node.js Design Patterns](https://nodejsdesignpatterns.com/)!
- 🎥 I'm currently refresh my knowledge of NodeJS with [NodeJS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) course!
- 🏠 Fascinated by [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) and always looking for excuses to use it!
- 🦕 Intrigued by the [Deno](https://deno.land) runtime, looking for excuses to build something with it!
- ✌️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything OSS but haven't quite found something I'm very interested in yet (open to suggestions!)
- ❤️ Beer🍺️, Coffee ☕️, Badminton 🏸, Cycling 🚴‍♂️️, Hiking 🗻️
